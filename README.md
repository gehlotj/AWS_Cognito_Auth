# JWT authentication using AWS Cognito and Google as IdP

In this article we will go over process of authenticating a web app using AWS Cognito & Google as a IdP. Once the user is authenticated the access token will be saved as a cookie which then can be used to access any authenticated end point as long as itâ€™s active.

The first step will be to set up the AWS Cognito user pools & Google. There is great tutorial that goes over all the steps that can be found on the following link:

-  Once authenticated the user will be redirected to authenticated URL/endpoint

- Configure all the variables as per the description below.
